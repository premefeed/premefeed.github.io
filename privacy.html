		<h3> Uptime </h3>

		Preme Feed's goal is to maintain 100% server uptime but there may be rare occasions that our servers are down due to maintenance, updates, or other unspecified reasoning. 
		</p3>

		<h3> Privacy Policy</h3>

		<h3>Compliance with children's online privacy protection act</h3>

		<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
